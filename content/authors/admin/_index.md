I am an incoming Master of Clinical Neuropsychology student at Macquarie University, under a full-ride scholarship from Ministry of Health Holdings, Singapore. Previously, I worked as a research assistant at the Clinical Brain Lab, at Nanyang Technological University from 2019 to 2021 and received my M.A. in Psychology from University of Edinburgh in 2019.

My research interests lie in high-order cognitive functions such as memory, decision-making, and emotional dysfunction and how their interplay is altered in diseased states. I am also particularly interested in the use of information theory (e.g., brain entropy) for predicting diagnostic and treatment outcomes for neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Outside of empirical research, I develop and maintain [open-source software](/#projects), including tools for neurophysiological signal processing, optical illusion generation, and working memory assessment.
