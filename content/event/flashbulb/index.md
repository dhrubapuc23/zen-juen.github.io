summary: An aIAT investigation of public and private flashbulb memories.
abstract: "Following major world events, individuals have reported exceptionally vivid and long-lasting memories of how they learnt about the news. These are termed flashbulb memories (FBMs) (Brown & Kulik, 1977), formed often in response to important, shocking and emotional episodes. A wealth of research suggests that FBMs constitute a special class of autobiographical memories, encoded at that moment in time like a snapshot. Recent studies have defined FBMs as only occurring with public events. In this study, we address the debate regarding whether FBMs are truly as special as previous findings show, and whether they also occur for private events. We argue that unlike what its term suggests, FBMs arise post- encoding and are operated on by a similar rehearsal mechanism as are ordinary memories. We compared memories of public and private events amongst 32 participants in 2 phases of data collection. The first phase constituted traditional measures of self-report, and the second phase involved an autobiographical implicit association task (aIAT). We hypothesized that 1) memory strength (assessed by explicit and implicit indices) for private events would be greater than that of public events as the former are more personally significant for individuals, and that 2) rehearsal frequency mediates this relationship. The present evidence did not support our hypotheses, nor did it support the view in previous literature that FBMs only occur for public events. There was no difference between explicit nor implicit indices across public and private events and rehearsal frequency was not predictive of memory strength. We also found that FBMs were recalled to high degrees of specificity, consistency and confidence, but were not automatically facilitated by the aIAT and hence implicate ordinary reconstructive processes.
Future research directions, implications and limitations are discussed."
