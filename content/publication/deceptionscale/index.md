abstract: The conceptualization of deception as a dispositional trait is under-represented in the literature. Despite scientific evidence supporting the existence of individual differences in lying, a validated measure of dispositional deception is still lacking. This study aims to explore the structure of dispositional deception by validating a 16-item questionnaire to characterize individualsâ€™ lying patterns. The final sample included 716 participants (Mean age = 25.02, 55.87% females) who were recruited via posters, flyers, and online social media platforms in Singapore. Our findings suggested four distinct latent dimensions; frequency, ability, negativity, and contextuality. We established the convergent validity of our measure by showing significant relationships with social desirability, malevolent traits, cognitive control deficits, normal and pathological personality traits, as well as demographic variables such as sex, age, and religiosity. Overall, the present study introduced a general framework to understanding deception as a dispositional trait.
