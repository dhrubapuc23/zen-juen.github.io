abstract: Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can be estimated using a myriad of mathematical indices, but the lack of systematic comparison between these indices renders the interpretation and evaluation of results tedious. In this study, we assessed the relationship between 57 HRV metrics collected from 302 human recordings using a variety of structure-analysis algorithms. We then applied a meta-clustering approach that combines their results to obtain a robust and reliable view of the observed relationships. We found that HRV metrics can be clustered into 3 groups, representing the core variability features, extreme variability features and frequency/complexity features. From there, we described and discussed their associations, and derived recommendations on which indices to prioritize for parsimonious, yet comprehensive HRV-related data analysis and reporting.
